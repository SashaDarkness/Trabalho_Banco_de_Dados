For default installation of MySQL 8.0.20:

i) Look for the initialization file located at C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini.

ii) Open my.ini file with notepad.

iii) Look for the headers [client], [mysql] under the CLIENT section & [mysqld] under the SERVER section.

iv) Add the following statement under each header:

local_infile=ON

v) Save the file and restart MySQL80 service under the Windows local services.

It should work.
